## Test Implementation Patterns

**MCP Tool Testing:**
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
from src.mcp.tools.containers import list_containers

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_list_containers_success():
    """Test successful container listing"""
    mock_ssh_result = MockSSHResult(
        stdout='{"Names":"nginx","Status":"Up 2 days"}',
        returncode=0
    )
    
    with patch('src.utils.ssh_client.ssh_execute', return_value=mock_ssh_result):
        result = await list_containers(device="test-device")
        
    assert result[0]["device"] == "test-device"
    assert result[0]["Names"] == "nginx"
    assert result[0]["Status"] == "Up 2 days"

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_list_containers_ssh_failure():
    """Test container listing with SSH failure"""
    with patch('src.utils.ssh_client.ssh_execute', side_effect=Exception("SSH timeout")):
        result = await list_containers(device="unreachable-device")
        
    assert result[0]["device"] == "unreachable-device"
    assert result[0]["error"] == "SSH timeout"
    assert result[0]["status"] == "unreachable"
```

**Database Testing:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def test_db_session():
    """Create test database session with rollback"""
    async with test_engine.begin() as conn:
        async with async_sessionmaker(conn) as session:
            yield session
            await session.rollback()

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_device_registration(test_db_session):
    """Test device registration in database"""
    device = Device(
        hostname="test-device",
        ip_address="192.168.1.100",
        device_type="ubuntu_vm",
        ssh_user="ubuntu"
    )
    
    test_db_session.add(device)
    await test_db_session.commit()
    
    result = await get_device_by_hostname("test-device", test_db_session)
    assert result.hostname == "test-device"
    assert result.device_type == "ubuntu_vm"
```

## Quality Validation Processes
