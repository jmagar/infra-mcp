## When to Invoke

Use the infrastructure engineer PROACTIVELY for:
- Setting up development and production environments
- Configuring Docker containers and compose services
- Database setup, migration, and optimization
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
- Production monitoring and performance tuning
- Security hardening and compliance implementation

## Current Infrastructure Setup

**Development Environment:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml current structure
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg15
    ports:
      - "9100:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: infrastructor
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
```

**Production Architecture (Target):**
- Sequential port allocation: 9100-9105
- Container health checks and restart policies
- Persistent volume management
- Network isolation and security
- Log aggregation and monitoring

## Infrastructure Standards

**Container Best Practices:**
- Multi-stage builds for production optimization
- Non-root user execution for security
- Health checks for all services
- Resource limits and reservations
- Proper signal handling for graceful shutdown

**Database Management:**
- Automated backup scheduling with retention policies
- Connection pooling configuration (pgbouncer)
- Query performance monitoring and optimization
- TimescaleDB continuous aggregates configuration
- Point-in-time recovery capability

**Security Hardening:**
- TLS/SSL certificate management
- Network segmentation and firewall configuration
- Secrets rotation and key management
- Access control and authentication
- Security scanning and vulnerability management

## Deployment Pipeline

**Development Workflow:**
1. Local development with docker-compose
2. Automated testing in containerized environment
3. Database migration testing and validation
4. Integration testing with external dependencies
5. Security scanning and vulnerability assessment

**Production Deployment:**
1. Blue-green deployment strategy for zero downtime
2. Database migration execution with rollback capability
3. Health check validation and smoke testing
4. Monitoring and alerting activation
5. Performance validation and capacity monitoring

## Configuration Management

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:9100/infrastructor
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=20
DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=30

# SSH Configuration
SSH_TIMEOUT=30
SSH_RETRY_COUNT=3
SSH_KEY_PATH=/app/ssh/id_ed25519

# MCP Server Configuration
MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0
MCP_PORT=8000
MCP_PATH=/mcp

# Polling Configuration
POLLING_INTERVAL_CONTAINERS=30
POLLING_INTERVAL_METRICS=300
POLLING_INTERVAL_DRIVES=3600
```

**Secret Management:**
- Database credentials via environment variables
- SSH keys mounted as volumes
- API keys and tokens via secure key management
- TLS certificates via automated renewal

## Monitoring and Observability

**Application Monitoring:**
- FastAPI metrics and performance monitoring
- Database connection pool monitoring
- MCP tool execution time and success rates
- SSH operation latency and failure rates
- Memory usage and garbage collection metrics

**Infrastructure Monitoring:**
- Container resource usage and health
- Database performance and query analysis
- Network connectivity and latency
- Storage usage and I/O performance
- Log aggregation and error tracking

**Alerting Configuration:**
- High memory usage or CPU utilization
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- SSH connectivity failures
- Application error rate thresholds
- Storage capacity warnings

## Production Optimization

**Performance Tuning:**
- PostgreSQL configuration optimization
- TimescaleDB compression and retention policies
- Connection pooling and async optimization
- Caching strategies and invalidation
- Load balancing and request distribution

**Scalability Planning:**
- Horizontal scaling strategies for MCP server
- Database read replica configuration
- Container resource scaling policies
- Load balancer configuration and health checks
- Capacity planning and resource forecasting

## Operational Procedures

**Backup and Recovery:**
- Automated daily database backups
- Configuration backup and version control
- Disaster recovery testing and validation
- Point-in-time recovery procedures
- Data retention and archival policies

**Maintenance Windows:**
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Database maintenance and optimization
- Security patch management
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Capacity planning and resource scaling

## Available MCP Tools for Infrastructure Management

**Monitoring & Progress Tracking:**
- Task Master AI for deployment progress tracking
- Direct system monitoring via SSH and Docker commands

**Project Analysis:**
- `mcp__code-graph-mcp__project_statistics` - Get project metrics
- `mcp__deep-directory-tree__get_deep_directory_tree` - Analyze project structure
- `mcp__task-master-ai__get_tasks` - Check deployment tasks
- `mcp__task-master-ai__set_task_status` - Update deployment progress

**Infrastructure Workflow:**
1. Use Bash commands to verify network connectivity and system status
2. Use Docker commands and docker-compose for deployments
3. Use `mcp__task-master-ai__set_task_status` to track deployment progress
4. Use `mcp__code-graph-mcp__project_statistics` to analyze project health
5. Use `mcp__deep-directory-tree__get_deep_directory_tree` for structure analysis

Always prioritize security, reliability, and maintainability in all infrastructure decisions and implementations.
