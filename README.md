**A comprehensive, API-driven infrastructure management and monitoring platform.**

`infrastructor` provides a powerful and flexible solution for managing and monitoring your entire infrastructure, from bare-metal servers to Docker containers. It combines a robust FastAPI backend with a flexible `fastmcp` server, giving you the power to manage your infrastructure through a REST API or a command-line interface.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Keep a close eye on all aspects of your infrastructure, including system metrics, drive health, container performance, and ZFS status.
*   **Container Management:** Easily manage your Docker containers with tools for listing, inspecting, and retrieving logs.
*   **Device Management:** Register and manage all of your infrastructure devices in a central location.
*   **Proxy Configuration Management:** Seamlessly manage your SWAG reverse proxy configurations.
*   **Time-Series Database:** `infrastructor` uses TimescaleDB to store and analyze time-series data, providing powerful insights into your infrastructure's performance over time.
*   **Dual-Interface:** Interact with your infrastructure through a powerful REST API or a flexible `fastmcp` command-line interface.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

`infrastructor` uses a dual-server architecture:

*   **FastAPI REST API:** A robust backend that provides a RESTful interface for managing and monitoring your infrastructure.
*   **`fastmcp` Server:** A flexible command-line interface that acts as a client to the REST API, providing a powerful and scriptable way to interact with your infrastructure.

This architecture ensures that all operations, whether initiated from the API or the MCP, go through the same centralized logic, providing a consistent and reliable management experience.

The schema also makes extensive use of TimescaleDB's features, including:

*   **Hypertables:** For efficient storage and querying of time-series data.
*   **Compression Policies:** To automatically compress old data and save storage space.
*   **Continuous Aggregates:** To pre-calculate hourly and daily summaries of the time-series data for faster querying.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

`infrastructor` uses a modern set of development tools and practices to ensure code quality and maintainability.
