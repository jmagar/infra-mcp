# Polling Service & WebSocket Implementation Plan

## Investigation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for making the polling service fully operational and implementing WebSocket real-time streaming capabilities in the infrastructor project.

### Current Status ‚úÖ
- **Polling Service**: Well-architected but **disabled by default** (`POLLING_ENABLED=false`)
- **Database**: TimescaleDB models ready for time-series data (`SystemMetric`, `DriveHealth`, `ContainerSnapshot`)
- **Infrastructure**: FastAPI server running on port 9101, MCP server on port 9102
- **Dependencies**: WebSocket library already included, notification service implemented
- **Integration**: Properly integrated with FastAPI lifecycle management

### Key Findings üîç
1. **Polling service is production-ready** but needs configuration and testing
2. **No WebSocket server exists** - needs full implementation
3. **Event system exists** via notification service - can be leveraged for real-time updates
4. **SSH parsing needs refinement** for reliable metrics collection
5. **Integration points are well-defined** for connecting polling to WebSocket broadcasting

## Implementation Strategy

## Phase 1: Enable Polling Service

### Current Implementation Assessment

**‚úÖ Strong Foundation:**
- **Comprehensive Configuration**: Full environment variable support with typed settings classes
- **Proper FastAPI Integration**: Graceful startup/shutdown with lifespan management  
- **TimescaleDB Ready**: Production-ready hypertables with compression and retention policies
- **Good Error Handling**: Consecutive failure tracking and device status management
- **Async Architecture**: Proper concurrent polling with per-device tasks

**‚ùå Identified Gaps:**
1. **Configuration Issues**: Hard-coded 300s poll interval instead of using configured intervals per metric type
2. **Incomplete Data Collection**: Network I/O metrics fields exist but not populated, SMART data parsing only extracts temperature
3. **Database Integration**: Several model fields not populated (memory_total_bytes, disk_total_bytes, etc.)

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Environment Configuration
**Required Settings:**
```bash
POLLING_ENABLED=true                           # Enable the service
POLLING_CONTAINER_INTERVAL=30                  # Container polling (30 seconds)
POLLING_SYSTEM_METRICS_INTERVAL=300           # System metrics (5 minutes)  
POLLING_DRIVE_HEALTH_INTERVAL=3600            # Drive health (1 hour)
POLLING_MAX_CONCURRENT_DEVICES=10              # Concurrent device limit
```

#### Step 2: Database Preparation
```bash
# Start database and run migrations
docker compose up postgres -d
cd apps/backend && uv run alembic upgrade head
```

#### Step 3: Fix Critical Polling Service Issues
**Issue 1**: Polling service uses hard-coded 300-second interval instead of configured intervals
**Issue 2**: `POLLING_MAX_CONCURRENT_DEVICES` setting is not enforced

#### Step 4: Device Registration
At least one device must be registered with `monitoring_enabled=true` before polling can begin.

#### Step 5: Service Startup and Testing
```bash
./dev.sh start
./dev.sh logs | grep -i polling
```

#### Step 6: Verification
- Check service logs for successful startup
- Verify data collection in TimescaleDB
- Monitor device connection status

**Expected Performance:**
- System Metrics: Every 5 minutes per device
- Container Data: Every 30 seconds per device  
- Drive Health: Every 1 hour per device

## Phase 2: Implement WebSocket Server

### Current WebSocket Implementation State

**‚úÖ What Already Exists:**
- **WebSocket Configuration**: Complete `WebSocketSettings` class configured for port 9102
- **Dependencies**: `websockets>=15.0.1` already included in pyproject.toml
- **Event System**: Comprehensive notification service with structured event patterns
- **Architecture Foundation**: Dual-server design (FastAPI REST + independent services)

**‚ùå What Needs to Be Built:**
- **WebSocket Server Implementation**: No actual WebSocket server code exists
- **Connection Management**: Client connection pool and subscription system
- **Message Protocol**: Standardized WebSocket message format
- **Event Bus**: Communication bridge between polling service and WebSocket server

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Create WebSocket Server Architecture
**Files to Create:**
```
apps/backend/src/websocket/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py              # Main WebSocket server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ connection_manager.py  # Connection pool & subscription management  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ message_protocol.py    # Message schemas and validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ event_bus.py          # Event distribution system
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.py               # WebSocket authentication
```

#### Step 2: Message Protocol Design
Based on existing notification service patterns, implement standardized message format:
```python
class MessageType(str, Enum):
    DATA = "data"           # Real-time metrics data
    EVENT = "event"         # Notification events  
    SUBSCRIPTION = "subscription"  # Client subscription changes
    HEARTBEAT = "heartbeat" # Connection keepalive
    ERROR = "error"         # Error messages
```

#### Step 3: Connection Management Architecture
**Client Connection Lifecycle:**
1. **Connect**: WebSocket handshake with Bearer token authentication
2. **Authenticate**: Validate token using existing auth system
3. **Subscribe**: Client specifies subscription topics
4. **Receive**: Stream real-time data and events
5. **Disconnect**: Cleanup subscriptions and connections

**Subscription Topics:**
- `devices.{device_id}` - Device-specific updates
- `categories.{category}` - Category-based filtering
- `global` - All events and data
- `metrics.{metric_type}` - Specific metric types

#### Step 4: Integration with Existing FastAPI Application
**Recommended**: Integrated approach using existing FastAPI app:
```python
# Add to apps/backend/src/main.py
from apps.backend.src.websocket.server import websocket_router
app.include_router(websocket_router, prefix="/ws")
```

#### Step 5: Authentication Integration
Leverage existing authentication system for WebSocket connections using Bearer tokens.

## Phase 3: Connect Polling to WebSockets

### Current Architecture Analysis

**Polling Service Structure:**
- **Asyncio-based**: Uses concurrent tasks for device polling
- **Session Factory Pattern**: Database operations through `get_async_session_factory()`
- **No Event System**: Currently only stores data, doesn't emit events
- **Service Lifecycle**: Managed by FastAPI lifespan with global instance

**Service Communication Gaps:**
- **No Inter-Service Communication**: Services operate independently
- **No Event Bus**: Missing pub/sub architecture
- **No Observer Pattern**: No event-driven architecture

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Event Bus Architecture
Create core event infrastructure with `BaseEvent` class and `EventBus` for async event processing:
```python
# apps/backend/src/core/events.py
class EventBus:
    def __init__(self):
        self._subscribers: Dict[str, List[Callable]] = {}
        self._event_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=1000)  # Bounded queue
```

#### Step 2: Event Models
Define structured events for different monitoring scenarios:
```python
class MetricCollectedEvent(BaseEvent):
    event_type: str = "metric_collected"
    cpu_usage: float
    memory_usage: float
    hostname: str

class DeviceStatusChangedEvent(BaseEvent):
    event_type: str = "device_status_changed"
    old_status: str
    new_status: str
```

#### Step 3: Polling Service Modifications
Modify `PollingService` to emit events without blocking operations:
```python
# Non-blocking event emission
self.event_bus.emit_nowait(MetricCollectedEvent(...))
```

#### Step 4: WebSocket Service Integration
Create `WebSocketManager` that subscribes to events and broadcasts to connected clients:
```python
class WebSocketManager:
    def _setup_event_handlers(self):
        self.event_bus.subscribe("metric_collected", self._handle_metric_event)
        self.event_bus.subscribe("device_status_changed", self._handle_device_status_event)
```

#### Step 5: FastAPI Application Integration
Integrate event bus and WebSocket manager into FastAPI lifecycle:
```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Initialize event bus
    event_bus = get_event_bus()
    await event_bus.start()
    
    # Initialize WebSocket manager
    websocket_manager = get_websocket_manager()
```

**Key Technical Benefits:**
- **Non-blocking Event System**: Polling service emits events without performance impact
- **Real-time WebSocket Streaming**: Clients receive live updates
- **Type-safe Event Architecture**: Pydantic models ensure data consistency
- **Error Isolation**: Event handler failures don't affect polling operations
